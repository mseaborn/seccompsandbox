- don't derefence the GOT when looking for syscallTable. This must be a
  secure memory access!

- audit error code handling in trusted_thread.cc. Most notably, add error
  handling, if mprotect() fails.

- get rid of preloader and of ELF helper process.

- clean up sandbox_impl.h, maybe create extra helper classes?

- address (or remove) remaining "TODO(markus):" statements.
