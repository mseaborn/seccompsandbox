- for better efficiency, try to find instances of RDTSC in glibc and rewrite
  them. That would avoid the signal handling, when it is not strictly
  necessary.

- audit error code handling in trusted_thread.cc. Most notably, add error
  handling, if mprotect() fails.

- get rid of preloader and of ELF helper process.

- clean up sandbox_impl.h, maybe create extra helper classes?

- address (or remove) remaining "TODO(markus):" statements.
