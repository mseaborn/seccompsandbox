- "char *mem" should be "SecureMem::Args *"

- no need to store processFd and cloneFd in TLS

- convert thread_XXX() functions to assembly and make them part of
  trusted_thread.cc; cleanup syscall_table.c

- there is a race condition where somebody could call mmap() from one
  trusted thread and be given a page in the secure cradle area,
  because this memory page briefly becomes available while another
  thread is calling clone. Detect this situation in the secure
  assembly code for mmap() and just re-run mmap().

- simplifly open() and ioctl()

- add 32 bit assembly

- get rid of __WORDSIZE, and use machine test macros instead

- rename all asm() labels to be more unique

- get rid of preloader and of ELF helper process

- clean up sandbox_impl.h, maybe create extra helper classes?
